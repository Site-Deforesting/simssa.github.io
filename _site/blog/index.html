(It was my first ISMIR too.)</p> <p></p> <p>Satellites before the conference included WoRMS, WiMIR, and the first-ever Workshop on Designing Human-Centric MIR systems.

This weekend coincided with a workshop for Julie Cumming’s new SSHRC Grant, Mapping the Musical Landscape of the 16th Century (MML16), as well as Jennifer Bain’s new partnership grant, Digital Analysis of Chant Transmission (DACT). Scholars involved in all three projects were here for a few days to make plans and exchange ideas, and the SIMSSA Workshop had around 45 attendees.</p> <p></p> <p>Ichiro Fujinaga: Welcome &amp; Introduction As always, Ich started the day with an overview of recent SIMSSA highlights, including workshops and other major projects.

Sally Jo Cunningham gave a CIRMMT Distinguished Lecture earlier that week on <a href="https://www.cirmmt.org/activities/distinguished-lectures/sally-jo-cunningham">Engagement with Personal Music Collections</a> which inspired our theme: Infrastructure for Music Discovery. We had 19 different speakers covering everything from OMR to library reference models to linked data to country music! Here is a roundup of all the presenter’s slides and some pictures from the event.</p> <p>To start the day, Ichiro Fujinaga gave us an overview of the project, including the most recent workshops and other activities. (Slides: <a href="http://localhost:4000/assets/files/fujinaga1-simssaxvii.pdf">PDF</a>).

    <p>Our fifteenth SIMSSA Workshop took place in Leipzig on 28 July 2018 immediately following the annual congress of the <a href="http://iaml2018.info/home/">International Association of Music Librarians</a>! Many of our partners and collaborators work in music libraries so it was a great chance to meet some of them and update each other on our work. In addition to my work for SIMSSA, I am also doing my MLIS, so it was really wonderful to get to meet so many people working on different aspects of librarianship and music. It was also fascinating to get a chance to learn more about Leipzig’s history as a centre for classical music and also as part of East Germany.</p> <p></p> <p>The Nikolaikirche downtown.

This workshop was designed as a companion to Eleanor Selfridge-Field’s CIRMMT Distinguished Lecture.

The presentation was titled <a href="http://localhost:4000/assets/files/claire-arthur-april27.pptx">“Whose Line is it Anyway?: Assessing Melodic Features of Mode in Polyphony.”</a> For this presentation, Claire described their study’s investigation of the nature of mode in polyphonic music.

We’re pretty excited to have you on board as a SIMSSA collaborator. Since music information retrieval as I’ve experienced it attracts folks with a lot of different disciplinary interests, I’m always curious about the paths people have taken to end up here.

Could you give us a little introduction to this method of music notation?</p> <p>Martha Thomae: Sure, mensural music refers to music written in mensural notation, a system that was used between the 1250s and the 1600s for vocal polyphonic music. Mensural notation is the immediate predecessor of our common Western music notation...

In “Reanimating Corpora: The Single Interface for Music Score Searching and Analysis (SIMSSA) and Distant Reading Early Modernity (DREaM)”, researchers from DREaM and SIMSSA shared some of their latest developments and talked about challenges in common when making decisions about how to organize large corpora, whether written texts or musical scores.</p> <p>SIMSSA started things off, with an <a href="http://localhost:4000/assets/files/fujinaga15DHWiP1.pdf">overview of SIMSSA</a> presented by Ichiro Fujinaga, our PI and Content Axis leader. He discussed the process of Optical Music Recognition, and what goes into developing the viewing and searching capacities for the interface we’re working towards.</p> <p>Next up, Alexander Morgan gave a presentation on <a href="http://localhost:4000/assets/files/AlexMIntegralAnalysisDHNov2015.pdf">“Integral Analysis in VIS.”</a> He talked about clustering composers’ work by comparing the similarity of the intervallic content of their works, demonstrating this technique with a...

    <p>Reiner Krämer has been working with SIMSSA as a Postdoc since July, and has been presenting on some of the work he’s done, most recently at <a href="https://societymusictheory.org/">SMT</a>. Today’s post is a guest entry from Reiner, explaining some of his recent work and its implications for music theory and musicology research.</p> <p>Using machine learning techniques as a compositional tool in music is almost as old as writing computer programs itself. When in 1957 Lejaren Hiller and Leonard Isaacson composed the Illiac Suite (also know as String Quartet No. 4), the researchers employed probability (p) tables generated that were used for Markov chain computations.<a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a> One of the main ideas behind Markov models is how to randomly move from on state to another. The task is statistically achieved by creating state transition matrices (STMs). A STM keeps a tally of how many times a state is changed from one...

    <p>Guest post from Alex Morgan, PhD student at McGill</p> <p>Over the summer we’ve been working to integrate hierarchical clustering into our <a href="http://vis-framework.readthedocs.org/en/vis-framework-2.0.0/">VIS Music Analysis Framework</a> to help us reveal latent structure in musical corpora. Hierarchical clustering is a type of machine learning that groups data sets by how similar they are to one another. In hierarchical clustering, we begin with n groups each containing one data set. In the example below, each starting group is the intervallic profile of a two-voice piece by Josquin, Lassus, or Morley. The two most similar groups are then merged with one another, leaving us with n - 1 groups. This process is repeated until all of the starting singleton groups are merged into one big group. Then, we look at the visual representation of this hierarchical clustering, called a dendrogram, and focus on the intermediary stages of grouping to see if any meaningful...

Picture taken by Jacob Sagrans, July 9, 2015.</p> <p>Yesterday I sat down and chatted with Reiner Krämer, who recently joined the SIMSSA team at McGill as a post-doctoral fellow. Reiner comes to us from the US, where he recently completed a PhD in music theory at the University of North Texas. His dissertation analyzed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_composition">algorithmic music</a> created through <a href="http://artsites.ucsc.edu/faculty/cope/">David Cope</a>’s artificial intelligence software <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/6404737/Emily-Howell-the-computer-program-that-composes-classical-music.html">Emily Howell</a>. As part of his dissertation research, Reiner investigated the feasibility of using machine learning techniques to analyze music written by a computer. He was excited to learn about the SIMSSA project last year at the annual meeting of the American Musicological Society and the Society for Music Theory—when he saw the announcement for the postdoc opening, he knew he had to apply.</p> <p>So far, Reiner has mostly been familiarizing himself...

Envied by courts across Europe, the Concerto delle donne quickly inspired a craze for female singers and sound. Prestigious courts in Mantua, Florence and Rome established rival ensembles within a few years of the Concerto delle donne’ s debut. No images are known to survive of the three core singers—Laura Peverara, Anna Guarini, and Livia D’Arco. This is despite their riveting vocal virtuosity as described by leading contemporary writers like Torquato Tasso and Giovanni Battista Guarini; their pioneering status as professional women at court, often...

    <p>This last weekend, a group of students from McGill attended the 2015 meeting of the Northeast Music Information Special Interest Group (NEMISIG) at Ithaca College and Cornell University in Ithaca, NY. Post-doctoral fellow Andrew Hankinson was there along with graduate students Ling-Xiao Yang and Andrew Horwitz. During the Research Talks section on the first day, Andrew Hankinson gave a talk on SIMSSA, mentioning:</p> An overview to the project similar to Ichiro’s introductory talk from the <a href="http://simssa.ca/blog/simssa-workshop-iva">SIMSSA Workshop IV</a> last September The progress on <a href="http://cantus.simssa.ca">Cantus Ultimus</a> Ling-Xiao’s work on <a href="https://github.com/DDMAL/Rodan">Rodan</a> Andrew Horwitz’s work on <a href="http://ddmal.github.io/diva.js/">Diva.JS</a> <p>He also gave an overview of the other work happening in the lab, including the <a href="http://cric.music.mcgill.ca/">CRIC</a> robotic harpsichord under construction and Gabriel Vigliensoni’s work on user context in music recommendation systems.</p> <p>With all the work that we’ve been putting into music over the last few months, this year’s NEMISIG came with...

Its main toolset still revolves around Optical Music Recognition, but it now also offers sophisticated musical querying, in the form of ELVIS.</p> <p>The main goal of SIMSSA is to provide access to digitized scores worldwide, from a single website. This involves not only the interlinking of libraries (see our <a href="http://simssa.ca/people">Partners</a> to see which libraries are on board so far), but also finding a wealth of music in books that have already been digitized by Google Books, Hathi Trust or other online resources.</p> <p>SIMSSA is redefining what “access” to scores means.

    <p>I’ve been working on the ELVIS project for a little bit over a month now. Though I began working with Christopher on the web-interface and back-end, in the past few weeks, I’ve been focused mostly on sonification.</p> <p>Sonification, in case you don’t know, is a systematic process in which data is transformed into sound. At the moment, I’ve been listening to the extracted intervals of Dufay, Josquin, Palestrina, and Beethoven at speeds up to 10,000 intervals per second. Though I predicted that sonification could be used to differentiate these corpora, it turns out that it can probably do much more. For the Digging into Data Conference, I’ve generated some recordings in which sonification exposes dramatic changes in the temporal evolution of the data, and helps identify patterns at local and global time scales.</p> <p>To give you an idea of what each interval sounds like, imagine a pianist lightly striking the...

This resource, the product of a JISM rapid igitization grant involving the Royal Holloway, British Library and RISM UK, incudes 324 anthologies of printed music from the sixteenth century, or around 10000 pieces. The pieces are rich in metadata but because the images are produced from microfilms, the image quaility is variable.</p> <p>The variable quality, along with book formats, notation types and printing methods, reduced the selection of pieces that Aruspix could process.

In most cases, OMR is so unreliable that it is faster for an advanced user to enter notation by hand than to correct all the errors made by the system. It is also improssible to improve the system because all the (numerous) processes involved in OMR are carried out in a “black box” process: you see what goes in and what comes out but none of what happens in the middle. It is difficult for two users to carry out work on a single source simultaneously, and each user is limited to the processing power of their desktop computer or laptop. OMR systems don’t learn, which has two implications: first, one...

    <p>On May 11th, after a successful and well-attended series of talks the afternoon before, the ELVIS team met in the CIRMMT seminar room for a kind of “Hack Day.” This involved getting out our laptops and sitting around the room, each with a set of specific tasks to address that day, alone or in groups, taking advantage of a lively but focused atmosphere and the resources of each others’ presence. For example, having Myke Cuthbert around made it possible to see with certainty which issues in VIS stemmed from the VIS programme itself, and which stemmed from Music21, which runs in conjunction with it, and to fix as many as possible. The presence of both musicologists and programmers in the room made it possible for concerns about music-analysis functionality to be addressed immediately. In some cases, teams were able to consult each other for advice on making queries, such as...

This is not a bad way to begin: by having to think about every file we put on the site, we now have a good idea of what kind of database we have, what kind of metadata it’s appropriate for us to collect, and problems that might come up with certain filetypes (MIDI files have been an adventure which I will relate in another post!). In order to expand our collection to the one we hoped for, we have to start automating processes. We are exploring how to automate uploading pieces that share the same metadata, and will hopefully have news on this soon. In the meantime, Ryan, a recent addition to our team, has learned a clever way...

With a good selection of pieces in the ELVIS database and the VIS/music21 interface up and running, it is time to come up with queries to run.</p> <p>One of the main goals of music theory and musicology since they began has been to try to pin down what gives a composer their personal style. Palestrina and Bach sound different even if they are both writing for a 4-part choir, as do Palestrina and Josquin (to slightly specialized ears), but where exactly do the differences lie? After all, these composers all follow many of the same contrapuntal rules, avoiding parallel 5ths and using many of the same formulations to start and end phrases. One of the main type of queries will be to see if analyzing the interaction of melodic and vertical intervals might provide musical fingerprints for composers. We will start with the above-named three because...

    <p>There has been a lot of coming and going in the lab over the summer months, people heading off in all directions for their weeks off. Some visiting family, some taking a holiday, and one touring the Americas with their highly successful rock band. That would be Gabriel. Gabriel is the Ph.D. student in the lab responsible for making OMR work: He does the nitty gritty of turning black-and-white images into sources of information. His screen is constantly filled with staff-finders and note shape processors which he writes, tests, and tweaks, unassumingly and patiently developing some of the most cutting-edge technology in the world.</p> <p>But this year, Gabriel has been whisked away by his band of a former life, <a href="http://www.lucybell.com/">Lucybell</a>, onto a reunion tour that marks their foundation at the Universidad de Chile 21 years ago. He has already played to packed houses all over Chile, and will be...

She showed us images of recovered music and watermarks from faded documents, discussed projects using optical recognition systems for differentiating the handwriting of scribes, and of course talked through the very practical implications for musicologists of not having to travel halfway across the world to see sources. “I’m wondering,” she...

So I’ve edited about 45 pieces in the last month - at least they will go into the ELVIS database. The rest of the time, I’ve got to know a few of the ins and outs of Drupal, and have been managing the ELVIS website (both the technical side and helping to establish rules and vocabularies) as well as contributing to it. To practise installing a module without worrying about side-effects, I put in a tag cloud so that we can see the most common...

    <p>In the last month or so I’ve been working primarily on designing the frontend for Rodan, as well as working on certain components of the backend. On the frontend side, I’ve been doing most of the templating/stylesheets/javascript for the interface of Rodan, except when it comes to the Javascript image processing modules (binarisation, despeckling, segmentation, rotation, and cropping - see Blog entry: JavaScript Image Processing Modules for Rodan). On the backend side of things, I worked on: creating a framework for easily creating tasks, the project/workflow management functionality, and a system for restarting and checking timing information for tasks, as well as miscellaneous bug fixes and feature additions in other areas. I also worked on integrating <a href="http://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/diva">Diva.js</a> into Rodan, and added the search highlighting features.</p>

    <p>This post will present a suite of JavaScript-based image processing modules, designed to operate on scaled-down versions or full-size portions of high-resolution music score images. These modules include binarisation, rotation, cropping, segmentation (for staff removal), and despeckling. For the Rodan project, it is essential to enable the users to correct the automated image processing algorithms in real-time, on the client-side. This is not possible with full-size images, as their high resolution causes long program execution times, but the scaled or partial images can provide useful previews for how an algorithm will run on the original file. When the user has finished adjusting the preview, the parameters of the operation they have performed (angle of rotation, binarisation threshold, etc.) are sent to a server-side program to run on the full image.</p>

    <p>Over the past few weeks I’ve added some new functionality and goodies to the Neon.js neume notation editor. Ornamentation: dots can now be toggled on puncta (neumes with one note). Clefs: shift clefs vertically on the staff, insert new clefs anywhere on the staff, delete clefs, and update the shape of a clef. Divisions: insert all four types of divisions, delete divisions, and move divisions. Custos: are tied to the first note on the next staff. The next tasks on the burner are handling more ornamentation: draw, insert, update, and delete episemata as well as drawing more complex neume structures in the editor.</p>

<p>You can see a demo of Neon.js in action here.</p>

<p>Also, the Neon.js paper was accepted to ISMIR 2012! See you in Porto!</p>

The shapes are modelled on those in the <a href="http://www.klemm-music.de/makemusic/finale/index.php">Finale medieval plug-in</a>, to which Greg has added dots and is working on adding the more unusual shapes from the Liber Usualis.</p> <p>But rendering is not all!

The only staff finder algorithm that considers non-parallel staff lines is the Miyao algorithm. Although it works very good in most cases, with our last manuscript, the Salzinnes Antiphonal, I have had some problems with this algorithm.</p> <p>The following image shows the staff lines being recognized by the Miyao processing. It can be seen that the algorithm does a good work in the recognized points, i.e., the points and staff lines are properly localized, but there are big portions of the staff lines that are not recognized at all. On top of that, there are overlapped zones of staffs, like in the second staff where the green and light blue zones coincide....

    <p>The premise of DIVA is that it’s a user-friendly interface that allows the browsing of high-resolution, multi-page documents. High quality images take a long time to download on an HTML website, so normally image quality is sacrificed to allow each image to be loaded before the site is browsable. For a book like Salzinnes with over 400 pages, even low-quality images would take a long time, so until now the usual strategy has been to present the book on different pages as thumbnails, with each image expandable (making browing very time consuming indeed), or to force the user to download a bulky .pdf in order to browse the whole book at once. DIVA is different: it’s optimized to load only what is in the viewing window at any given moment, making it possible to browse through high quality images with minimal load time and no need to download a file....

<p>This launch is timed to coincide with a talk given at the 2011 International Society of Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) conference in Miami, FL. This talk, titled <a href="http://ismir2011.ismir.net/papers/OS3-1.pdf">“The Music Encoding Initiative as a document-encoding framework”</a> describes how MEI can be used to rapidly develop support for new notation encoding systems.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/libmei">LibMEI website</a> has more information about this software, including how to get and use software, documentation, and an issue tracker.</p>

Most of the images of music put up on the Internet are in the forms .jpeg or .pdfs that began their existence as .jpeg files. The problem with .jpeg is that it involves “lossy compression,” or compression by discarding bits of data. Jpegs are clever because they discard data that the eye tends not to notice at a distance or in web viewing, but when we try to manipulate the file or blow it up to many times its size, this loss of data becomes apparent: little halos appear around notes...

Here you can learn about the ins and outs of this cutting-edge project, which involves developing Optical Music Recognition (OMR) to allow computers read music of many different notational styles, making digital scores searchable. Just as when you scan a text, a computer will use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to convert graphics into letters, OMR converts notated music into a form where it can be separated out into its components and analyzed. You can already browse the results of last year’s project, where the <a href="http://liber.simssa.ca/">lab taught a computer how to read the Liber Usualis</a>.</p> <p>Now our exciting piece of news is that we’ve received and put online a digital copy of the <a href="http://salzinnes.simssa.ca/">Salzinnes Antiphonal</a>.

    <p>Martha Thomae is a PhD student in the Music Tech Department, working on mensural notation for the SIMSSA Project. Originally from Guatemala, she came to Montreal for her Master’s in Music Technology in 2015 and she started her PhD here this past fall. She’s pictured below at the beach in Calahonda, Motril, in the Granada province of Spain. Music Theory PhD student Sam Howes (read our interview with him in 2016 <a href="http://simssa.ca/blog/from-module-to-schema-an-interview-with-sam-howes">here</a>) interviewed her about her work on her Master’s thesis and some more current projects.</p> <p></p> <p>Sam Howes: Most musicians today have never seen mensural music. Could you give us a little introduction to this method of music notation?</p> <p>Martha Thomae: Sure, mensural music refers to music written in mensural notation, a system that was used between the 1250s and the 1600s for vocal polyphonic music. Mensural notation is the immediate predecessor of our common Western music notation...

In “Reanimating Corpora: The Single Interface for Music Score Searching and Analysis (SIMSSA) and Distant Reading Early Modernity (DREaM)”, researchers from DREaM and SIMSSA shared some of their latest developments and talked about challenges in common when making decisions about how to organize large corpora, whether written texts or musical scores.</p> <p>SIMSSA started things off, with an <a href="http://localhost:4000/assets/files/fujinaga15DHWiP1.pdf">overview of SIMSSA</a> presented by Ichiro Fujinaga, our PI and Content Axis leader. He discussed the process of Optical Music Recognition, and what goes into developing the viewing and searching capacities for the interface we’re working towards.</p> <p>Next up, Alexander Morgan gave a presentation on <a href="http://localhost:4000/assets/files/AlexMIntegralAnalysisDHNov2015.pdf">“Integral Analysis in VIS.”</a> He talked about clustering composers’ work by comparing the similarity of the intervallic content of their works, demonstrating this technique with a...

    <p>Reiner Krämer has been working with SIMSSA as a Postdoc since July, and has been presenting on some of the work he’s done, most recently at <a href="https://societymusictheory.org/">SMT</a>. Today’s post is a guest entry from Reiner, explaining some of his recent work and its implications for music theory and musicology research.</p> <p>Using machine learning techniques as a compositional tool in music is almost as old as writing computer programs itself. When in 1957 Lejaren Hiller and Leonard Isaacson composed the Illiac Suite (also know as String Quartet No. 4), the researchers employed probability (p) tables generated that were used for Markov chain computations.<a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a> One of the main ideas behind Markov models is how to randomly move from on state to another. The task is statistically achieved by creating state transition matrices (STMs). A STM keeps a tally of how many times a state is changed from one...

    <p>Guest post from Alex Morgan, PhD student at McGill</p> <p>Over the summer we’ve been working to integrate hierarchical clustering into our <a href="http://vis-framework.readthedocs.org/en/vis-framework-2.0.0/">VIS Music Analysis Framework</a> to help us reveal latent structure in musical corpora. Hierarchical clustering is a type of machine learning that groups data sets by how similar they are to one another. In hierarchical clustering, we begin with n groups each containing one data set. In the example below, each starting group is the intervallic profile of a two-voice piece by Josquin, Lassus, or Morley. The two most similar groups are then merged with one another, leaving us with n - 1 groups. This process is repeated until all of the starting singleton groups are merged into one big group. Then, we look at the visual representation of this hierarchical clustering, called a dendrogram, and focus on the intermediary stages of grouping to see if any meaningful...

Picture taken by Jacob Sagrans, July 9, 2015.</p> <p>Yesterday I sat down and chatted with Reiner Krämer, who recently joined the SIMSSA team at McGill as a post-doctoral fellow. Reiner comes to us from the US, where he recently completed a PhD in music theory at the University of North Texas. His dissertation analyzed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_composition">algorithmic music</a> created through <a href="http://artsites.ucsc.edu/faculty/cope/">David Cope</a>’s artificial intelligence software <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/6404737/Emily-Howell-the-computer-program-that-composes-classical-music.html">Emily Howell</a>. As part of his dissertation research, Reiner investigated the feasibility of using machine learning techniques to analyze music written by a computer. He was excited to learn about the SIMSSA project last year at the annual meeting of the American Musicological Society and the Society for Music Theory—when he saw the announcement for the postdoc opening, he knew he had to apply.</p> <p>So far, Reiner has mostly been familiarizing himself...

Envied by courts across Europe, the Concerto delle donne quickly inspired a craze for female singers and sound. Prestigious courts in Mantua, Florence and Rome established rival ensembles within a few years of the Concerto delle donne’ s debut. No images are known to survive of the three core singers—Laura Peverara, Anna Guarini, and Livia D’Arco. This is despite their riveting vocal virtuosity as described by leading contemporary writers like Torquato Tasso and Giovanni Battista Guarini; their pioneering status as professional women at court, often...

    <p>This last weekend, a group of students from McGill attended the 2015 meeting of the Northeast Music Information Special Interest Group (NEMISIG) at Ithaca College and Cornell University in Ithaca, NY. Post-doctoral fellow Andrew Hankinson was there along with graduate students Ling-Xiao Yang and Andrew Horwitz. During the Research Talks section on the first day, Andrew Hankinson gave a talk on SIMSSA, mentioning:</p> An overview to the project similar to Ichiro’s introductory talk from the <a href="http://simssa.ca/blog/simssa-workshop-iva">SIMSSA Workshop IV</a> last September The progress on <a href="http://cantus.simssa.ca">Cantus Ultimus</a> Ling-Xiao’s work on <a href="https://github.com/DDMAL/Rodan">Rodan</a> Andrew Horwitz’s work on <a href="http://ddmal.github.io/diva.js/">Diva.JS</a> <p>He also gave an overview of the other work happening in the lab, including the <a href="http://cric.music.mcgill.ca/">CRIC</a> robotic harpsichord under construction and Gabriel Vigliensoni’s work on user context in music recommendation systems.</p> <p>With all the work that we’ve been putting into music over the last few months, this year’s NEMISIG came with...

Its main toolset still revolves around Optical Music Recognition, but it now also offers sophisticated musical querying, in the form of ELVIS.</p> <p>The main goal of SIMSSA is to provide access to digitized scores worldwide, from a single website. This involves not only the interlinking of libraries (see our <a href="http://simssa.ca/people">Partners</a> to see which libraries are on board so far), but also finding a wealth of music in books that have already been digitized by Google Books, Hathi Trust or other online resources.</p> <p>SIMSSA is redefining what “access” to scores means.

    <p>I’ve been working on the ELVIS project for a little bit over a month now. Though I began working with Christopher on the web-interface and back-end, in the past few weeks, I’ve been focused mostly on sonification.</p> <p>Sonification, in case you don’t know, is a systematic process in which data is transformed into sound. At the moment, I’ve been listening to the extracted intervals of Dufay, Josquin, Palestrina, and Beethoven at speeds up to 10,000 intervals per second. Though I predicted that sonification could be used to differentiate these corpora, it turns out that it can probably do much more. For the Digging into Data Conference, I’ve generated some recordings in which sonification exposes dramatic changes in the temporal evolution of the data, and helps identify patterns at local and global time scales.</p> <p>To give you an idea of what each interval sounds like, imagine a pianist lightly striking the...

This resource, the product of a JISM rapid igitization grant involving the Royal Holloway, British Library and RISM UK, incudes 324 anthologies of printed music from the sixteenth century, or around 10000 pieces. The pieces are rich in metadata but because the images are produced from microfilms, the image quaility is variable.</p> <p>The variable quality, along with book formats, notation types and printing methods, reduced the selection of pieces that Aruspix could process.

In most cases, OMR is so unreliable that it is faster for an advanced user to enter notation by hand than to correct all the errors made by the system. It is also improssible to improve the system because all the (numerous) processes involved in OMR are carried out in a “black box” process: you see what goes in and what comes out but none of what happens in the middle. It is difficult for two users to carry out work on a single source simultaneously, and each user is limited to the processing power of their desktop computer or laptop. OMR systems don’t learn, which has two implications: first, one...

    <p>On May 11th, after a successful and well-attended series of talks the afternoon before, the ELVIS team met in the CIRMMT seminar room for a kind of “Hack Day.” This involved getting out our laptops and sitting around the room, each with a set of specific tasks to address that day, alone or in groups, taking advantage of a lively but focused atmosphere and the resources of each others’ presence. For example, having Myke Cuthbert around made it possible to see with certainty which issues in VIS stemmed from the VIS programme itself, and which stemmed from Music21, which runs in conjunction with it, and to fix as many as possible. The presence of both musicologists and programmers in the room made it possible for concerns about music-analysis functionality to be addressed immediately. In some cases, teams were able to consult each other for advice on making queries, such as...

(Ichiro calls this method—I presume affectionately—”gradsourcing”.) This is not a bad way to begin: by having to think about every file we put on the site, we now have a good idea of what kind of database we have, what kind of metadata it’s appropriate for us to collect, and problems that might come up with certain filetypes (MIDI files have been an adventure which I will relate in another post!). In order to expand our collection to the one we hoped for, we have to start automating processes. We are exploring how to automate uploading pieces that share the same metadata, and will hopefully have news on this soon. In the meantime, Ryan, a recent addition to our team, has learned a clever way...

With a good selection of pieces in the ELVIS database and the VIS/music21 interface up and running, it is time to come up with queries to run.</p> <p>One of the main goals of music theory and musicology since they began has been to try to pin down what gives a composer their personal style. Palestrina and Bach sound different even if they are both writing for a 4-part choir, as do Palestrina and Josquin (to slightly specialized ears), but where exactly do the differences lie? After all, these composers all follow many of the same contrapuntal rules, avoiding parallel 5ths and using many of the same formulations to start and end phrases. One of the main type of queries will be to see if analyzing the interaction of melodic and vertical intervals might provide musical fingerprints for composers. We will start with the above-named three because...

    <p>There has been a lot of coming and going in the lab over the summer months, people heading off in all directions for their weeks off. Some visiting family, some taking a holiday, and one touring the Americas with their highly successful rock band. That would be Gabriel. Gabriel is the Ph.D. student in the lab responsible for making OMR work: He does the nitty gritty of turning black-and-white images into sources of information. His screen is constantly filled with staff-finders and note shape processors which he writes, tests, and tweaks, unassumingly and patiently developing some of the most cutting-edge technology in the world.</p> <p>But this year, Gabriel has been whisked away by his band of a former life, <a href="http://www.lucybell.com/">Lucybell</a>, onto a reunion tour that marks their foundation at the Universidad de Chile 21 years ago. He has already played to packed houses all over Chile, and will be...

She showed us images of recovered music and watermarks from faded documents, discussed projects using optical recognition systems for differentiating the handwriting of scribes, and of course talked through the very practical implications for musicologists of not having to travel halfway across the world to see sources. “I’m wondering,” she...

So I’ve edited about 45 pieces in the last month - at least they will go into the ELVIS database. The rest of the time, I’ve got to know a few of the ins and outs of Drupal, and have been managing the ELVIS website (both the technical side and helping to establish rules and vocabularies) as well as contributing to it. To practise installing a module without worrying about side-effects, I put in a tag cloud so that we can see the most common...

    <p>In the last month or so I’ve been working primarily on designing the frontend for Rodan, as well as working on certain components of the backend. On the frontend side, I’ve been doing most of the templating/stylesheets/javascript for the interface of Rodan, except when it comes to the Javascript image processing modules (binarisation, despeckling, segmentation, rotation, and cropping - see Blog entry: JavaScript Image Processing Modules for Rodan). On the backend side of things, I worked on: creating a framework for easily creating tasks, the project/workflow management functionality, and a system for restarting and checking timing information for tasks, as well as miscellaneous bug fixes and feature additions in other areas. I also worked on integrating <a href="http://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/diva">Diva.js</a> into Rodan, and added the search highlighting features.</p>

    <p>This post will present a suite of JavaScript-based image processing modules, designed to operate on scaled-down versions or full-size portions of high-resolution music score images. These modules include binarisation, rotation, cropping, segmentation (for staff removal), and despeckling. For the Rodan project, it is essential to enable the users to correct the automated image processing algorithms in real-time, on the client-side. This is not possible with full-size images, as their high resolution causes long program execution times, but the scaled or partial images can provide useful previews for how an algorithm will run on the original file. When the user has finished adjusting the preview, the parameters of the operation they have performed (angle of rotation, binarisation threshold, etc.) are sent to a server-side program to run on the full image.</p>

    <p>Over the past few weeks I’ve added some new functionality and goodies to the Neon.js neume notation editor. Ornamentation: dots can now be toggled on puncta (neumes with one note). Clefs: shift clefs vertically on the staff, insert new clefs anywhere on the staff, delete clefs, and update the shape of a clef. Divisions: insert all four types of divisions, delete divisions, and move divisions. Custos: are tied to the first note on the next staff. The next tasks on the burner are handling more ornamentation: draw, insert, update, and delete episemata as well as drawing more complex neume structures in the editor.</p>

<p>You can see a demo of Neon.js in action here.</p>

<p>Also, the Neon.js paper was accepted to ISMIR 2012! See you in Porto!</p>

The shapes are modelled on those in the <a href="http://www.klemm-music.de/makemusic/finale/index.php">Finale medieval plug-in</a>, to which Greg has added dots and is working on adding the more unusual shapes from the Liber Usualis.</p> <p>But rendering is not all!

The only staff finder algorithm that considers non-parallel staff lines is the Miyao algorithm. Although it works very good in most cases, with our last manuscript, the Salzinnes Antiphonal, I have had some problems with this algorithm.</p> <p>The following image shows the staff lines being recognized by the Miyao processing. It can be seen that the algorithm does a good work in the recognized points, i.e., the points and staff lines are properly localized, but there are big portions of the staff lines that are not recognized at all. On top of that, there are overlapped zones of staffs, like in the second staff where the green and light blue zones coincide....

    <p>The premise of DIVA is that it’s a user-friendly interface that allows the browsing of high-resolution, multi-page documents. High quality images take a long time to download on an HTML website, so normally image quality is sacrificed to allow each image to be loaded before the site is browsable. For a book like Salzinnes with over 400 pages, even low-quality images would take a long time, so until now the usual strategy has been to present the book on different pages as thumbnails, with each image expandable (making browing very time consuming indeed), or to force the user to download a bulky .pdf in order to browse the whole book at once. DIVA is different: it’s optimized to load only what is in the viewing window at any given moment, making it possible to browse through high quality images with minimal load time and no need to download a file....

    <p>It’s been a busy week here in the lab as we all prepare for the presentation of the SIMSSA project at the <a href="http://www.ams-net.org/sanfrancisco/">AMS Conference</a> next week.</p> <p>Our .tiff files have arrived and Remi and Laura have been back in <a href="http://gamera.informatik.hsnr.de/">gamera</a>, once again teaching the computer to distinguish between a podatus and a c-clef, a custos and a punctum inclinatum, and pitches in general from the random specs of dirt and discolouration on each page of music. I had a go on the program too at last, only to find myself proceeding at a snail’s pace in comparison to the other two. When I complained, Laura came in and showed me a myriad tricks and shortcuts she had found to speed things up, in particular how to tell the computer to approve the classification of many instances of the same object at once instead of sorting through one by...

    <p>As part of our ongoing development of tools necessary to support the OMR of musical materials, we are launching the first beta version of <a href="http://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/libmei">LibMEI</a>, a C++ application library that supports the reading and writing of MEI music notation files.</p>

<p>This launch is timed to coincide with a talk given at the 2011 International Society of Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) conference in Miami, FL. This talk, titled <a href="http://ismir2011.ismir.net/papers/OS3-1.pdf">“The Music Encoding Initiative as a document-encoding framework”</a> describes how MEI can be used to rapidly develop support for new notation encoding systems.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/libmei">LibMEI website</a> has more information about this software, including how to get and use software, documentation, and an issue tracker.</p>

    <p>This past week, while we wait for our .tiffs to be ready for OMR, we’ve been combing and parsing the plethora of information available in the <a href="http://cantusdatabase.org/">CANTUS</a> database. And what a fantastic resource it is! For each Latin ecclesiastical chant in each manuscript, CANTUS gives a page of information. The information for the first chant set to music in <a href="http://salzinnes.simssa.ca/">Salzinnes</a>, for instance, looks like this: </p> <p>As the first two letters of SIMSSA stand for “Single Interface,” we’d like to make this information available on the same system as the searchable images of the Salzinnes antiphonal. As space is not an issue, we’d also like to automatically expand the abbreviations to their full names without having to refer to the legend, so I’ve been getting my head around reading the above, especially the liturgical use information, thanks to the legends provided on the CANTUS website. The feast, Dom....

    <p>We’ve been working on getting our new book, the <a href="http://salzinnes.simssa.ca/">Salzinnes Antiphonal</a>, prepped and ready for the OMR process. Part of this process involves separating the different components of the images into different files, minimizing clutter and reducing the amount of information that the computer will have to work with.</p> <p>We start with a fairly handsome page. Meet Salzinnes f. 9r:</p> <p></p> <p>The first thing we need to do is to convert this image to black-and-white through a process called “binarization.” This process makes it very easy for a computer to decide what parts of the image are important and what aren’t. If it’s a black pixel, the computer needs to do something about it; if it’s a white pixel, it can ignore it. The binarization process cleans up some of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxing">foxing</a>, page creases, and other bits of the image that the computer might otherwise eventually confuse with...

    <p>First of all, a hearty congratulations to SIMSSA’s Wendy Liu and lab-partner Saining Li for their <a href="http://www.mcgilldaily.com/2011/10/coding-coffee-and-concrete-innovation/">good citizenship award at the Montreal Hackathon</a>, for improving their wikinotes.ca site to make note sharing more accessible to students.</p> <p>The question of the week is: How does the quality of an image affect a computer’s success at Optical Music Recognition (OMR)? Most of the images of music put up on the Internet are in the forms .jpeg or .pdfs that began their existence as .jpeg files. The problem with .jpeg is that it involves “lossy compression,” or compression by discarding bits of data. Jpegs are clever because they discard data that the eye tends not to notice at a distance or in web viewing, but when we try to manipulate the file or blow it up to many times its size, this loss of data becomes apparent: little halos appear around notes...

    <p>Welcome to the new blog for the project “Single Interface for Music Score Searching and Analysis” (SIMSSA). Here you can learn about the ins and outs of this cutting-edge project, which involves developing Optical Music Recognition (OMR) to allow computers read music of many different notational styles, making digital scores searchable. Just as when you scan a text, a computer will use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to convert graphics into letters, OMR converts notated music into a form where it can be separated out into its components and analyzed. You can already browse the results of last year’s project, where the <a href="http://liber.simssa.ca/">lab taught a computer how to read the Liber Usualis</a>.</p> <p>Now our exciting piece of news is that we’ve received and put online a digital copy of the <a href="http://salzinnes.simssa.ca/">Salzinnes Antiphonal</a>. This is the manuscript which we’ll use for the next step of our project: teaching a computer...
